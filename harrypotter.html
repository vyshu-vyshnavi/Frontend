        <p>Harry Potter is a fictional character and the main protagonist of the popular book series by J.K. Rowling. He is an orphaned boy who discovers he is a wizard and is invited to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry is known for his lightning-bolt scar, a result of a failed attack by the dark wizard Voldemort, who also killed his parents. At Hogwarts, he befriends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger and becomes a key figure in the fight against Voldemort and his Death Eaters. Throughout the series, Harry navigates the challenges of adolescence, learns more about his parents' legacy, and ultimately defeats Voldemort. </p>
